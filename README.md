## üìÑ Introduction : 
Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription streaming service and production company. Launched on
August 29, 1997, it offers a film and television series library through distribution deals as well as its
own productions, known as Netflix Originals.
Netflix can be accessed via internet browser on computers, or via application software installed on
smart TVs, set-top boxes connected to televisions, tablet computers, smartphones, digital media

players, Blu-ray Disc players, video game consoles and virtual reality headsets on the list of Netflix-
compatible devices. It is available in 4K resolution.

Netflix has become dominant company in the on-demand media industry, with 167 million paying
subscribers around the world. By creating compelling original programming, analysing its user data to
serve subscribers better, and above all by letting people consume content in the ways they prefer,
Netflix disrupted the television industry and forced cable companies to change the way they do
business.

## üéØ Objective:
Our main objectives of this project is to do exploratory analysis and find useful insights from dataset,
to understand what type content is available in different countries, also to find out is Netflix has
increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years and at last to do clustering of similar
content by matching text-based features from dataset.

## üõ† Data Pre-processing:
We have been provided a dataset collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has
nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service‚Äôs number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000
titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what
all other insights can be obtained from the same data set.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis:
We started this project with the intention to obtain some useful insights related to the type of Netflix
content. For this, we performed exploratory data analysis on our data after cleaning and making it
easy to analyse. This analysis helped us to understand the trend. We found that most of the content
on Netflix are of TV-MA and TV-14 rating. USA and India are two countries producing the maximum
number of contents. Documentaries and stand up are top genre in terms of number of contents they
have on platform. Further we found number of movies on Netflix outnumbers TV-shows.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Fitting:
Our next job was to make an unsupervised clustering model. For this, we processed our text by
removing unuseful characters like - stop words, punctuation and did stemming. After getting the
length for each text feature we rescaled them for generalisation and started applying algorithms. We
first used K-means clustering. In order to find appropriate cluster number, we used elbow method and
finally got the best silhouette score of around 0.35. Next, we applied Hierarchal Agglomerative
Clustering for which we made dendrogram. We also obtained silhouette score of around 0.32. With
this we achieved our objectives of the project.
